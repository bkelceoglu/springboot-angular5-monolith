FTL

This is the core project for orginal FTL project to make Spring Boot + NG5 monolithic application.

Angular5 which is named as frontend is embedded to spring boot application which is named as backend.

At the root of the project
you have to run 

./mvnw clean install

then you can run the project with

java -jar backend/target/backend-0.0.1.jar

i have added sample user entity for backend yet it is not connected to frontend ng application.
